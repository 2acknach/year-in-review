<h2>A quick recap</h2>
<p>This year has been far from the best, to be honest this might have been the worst year of my life. This year didn't really start off all that well and it only got worse as time went on, in the beginning of this year nothing much was really going on and my life was going pretty well, usually my day would start off by waking up and going to school then coming home and eating food and biking and on weekends I would wake up in the afternoon and eat breakfast then bike almost the whole day. Then as time went on we all heard about covid-19 and I almost thought it was a joke to be honest and was kind of hoping that school would end but I quickly regretted that, because being in school provides many more opportunities and is much more fun.</p>
