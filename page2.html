    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>I used to bake a lot then I stopped baking for awhile and over quarantine i've started baking again, the first things I started making were cakes, chocolate, confetti, and lemon, they were all pretty good then started making muffins, I made banana chocolate muffins, that was it for muffins, and now i'm making Cookies!! I started making snickerdoodle cookies then started making a perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. My recipe now is milk chocolate, white chocolate, and some dark chocolate. They are amazing.<p>
